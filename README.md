# Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS)

## Overview

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a project designed to showcase my skills in cloud technologies. This project involves creating a serverless website that tracks and displays the number of visits using AWS services.

## Creating the Site with HTML and CSS

The front end of the site was built using HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. I have used a website template which consists of HTML & CSS. I've opted to do this rather than creating a website from scratch as this project's main aim is to gain some solid experience using AWS and related DevOps tooling.
