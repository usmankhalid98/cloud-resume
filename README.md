# Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS)

## Overview

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a project designed to showcase my skills in cloud technologies. This project involves creating a serverless website that tracks and displays the number of visits using AWS services. Below is the Architectural Diagram of my cloud resume challenge.

## Creating the Site with HTML and CSS

The front end of the site was built using HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. I have used a website template which consists of HTML & CSS. I've opted to do this rather than creating a website from scratch as this project's main aim is to gain some solid experience using AWS and related DevOps tooling.

## S3 (Storing my website files in S3)

To get started, I use Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) to store my website's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. S3 provides highly durable and scalable object storage, making it perfect for hosting static content. By creating an S3 bucket, I can securely store and manage my websiteâ€™s files. I begin by creating a new bucket, selecting a unique name, and choose the eu-west-2 (London) which is the region that best fits my requirements.

I make sure to keep ACLs disabled and enable the "Block all public access" setting to prevent any unauthorized public access to the contents stored in the bucket.
